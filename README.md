# Real-Time Object Detection with YOLOv3

This repository contains a Python implementation of real-time object detection using the YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once, Version 3) algorithm. YOLOv3 is a state-of-the-art object detection system that combines excellent performance with high accuracy, making it suitable for various applications such as surveillance systems, autonomous vehicles, robotics, and augmented reality.

## Features

- Real-time object detection from a webcam or video feed
- Utilizes the powerful YOLOv3 algorithm for object detection
- Supports the COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset with 80 object categories
- Draws bounding boxes and labels around detected objects
- Displays confidence scores for each detection
- Non-maximum suppression (NMS) for removing overlapping bounding boxes

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required dependencies
3. Download the pre-trained YOLOv3 weights and configuration files
4. Update the paths to the weight and configuration files in the code
5. Run the script
6. Press 'q' to exit the program
